## 16b signal processor
Signal processing using outlier detection and Gausian lowpass filter to remove sharp signals with outliers.

### Prerequisites
* Matplotlib
* Numpy

### Usage
1. Reads `.csv`files from the `recordings` directory, so make sure all inputs are valid csv files in the `recordings` directory.
2. The code will take care of the rest. Run all cells in the Jupyter notebook, and get visualizations and a directory of nice outputs!
